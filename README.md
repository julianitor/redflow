# redflow
The new redradix client stack for building fast, scalable, testable and memorable applications.

## What is it?
It is a minimal client base app with **React** to empower performance, **global immutable state** using morijs to increase easiness on development and a **variant of Facebook's Flux** architecture to create more clear and readable code in less time.

This branch is a full featured Todo application, which saves your list to your browser's local storage.

##How to install?
1. Run npm install
2. Run npm start
3. Start coding

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to your code will trigger re-building, but you'll have to manually refresh your browser.
